# REST API Client Project Overview

# The REST API Client is a software application designed to interact with RESTful web services. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. A REST API client acts as the consumer of these services, allowing users or other applications to send HTTP requests and receive responses from servers that expose REST APIs.

# This project provides a user-friendly interface to test, manage, and automate API requests. It is often used by developers, testers, and DevOps professionals to interact with backend services without the need for a complete frontend application. This can be especially useful during the development and debugging of APIs.

# *Key Features *

# HTTP Methods Support: The client supports all major HTTP methods including:

# GET: Retrieve data from a server.

# POST: Send data to the server, typically for creating resources.
# PUT: Update existing data.
# DELETE: Remove data from the server.
# Customizable Requests: Users can define:

# Request URLs
# Headers (e.g., Authorization tokens, Content-Type)
# Query parameters
# Body content (in JSON, XML, or form data formats)
# Response Viewer:

# View the raw response data
# Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
# Headers
# Response time
# Formatted (pretty) JSON output
